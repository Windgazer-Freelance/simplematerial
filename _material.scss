 #Simple Material Design

 This is a simplistic implementation of Material Design. However, it should allow for a
 quick and easy implementation of HTML5 apps with an acceptable base design.

 Check out the examples.scss file for a common implementation, check the docs written in
 the scss files for detailed info on what all the partials do.
