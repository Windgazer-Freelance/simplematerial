# SASS Tricks, Material Design

This should be a simplistic implementation of Material Design. I'm attempting to stay
close-ish to the [specs][1] defined by google. Although I'm not aiming for pixels, I've
never believed in pixels, instead I'm using em's all the way, the base-font will determine
what eventual size you end up with.

I do try to adhere to the basic relative white-spacing / font-sizes that are in the
[specs][1] and I try to keep to the 'plain' coloring and minimalistic drop-shadows as much
as I can. In the end this is simply an attempt at making a quick-start styling framework
for my own html5 based projects.
